# Database Components

A database system consists of two main components: the **server** and the **client**. These components work together to manage and process data efficiently.

### 1. Server Component
- The server is where actual data is stored.
- It processes queries received from clients, executes them against the database, and returns the results.
- The server component must be installed and running for the database system to function.

### 2. Client Component
- The client is a lightweight software where we write SQL queries.
- It must have the address of the server component to establish a connection.
- The database client serves as a user interface or application that interacts with the database server to perform operations such as querying, updating, and managing data.

### Types of Client Components
The client component can be categorized into two types:

**1. GUI (Graphical User Interface)**
- Provides a user-friendly interface with visual tools for interacting with the database.
- More convenient and easier to use.
- Example: MySQL Workbench

**2. CLI (Command Line Interface)**
- Uses text-based commands to interact with the database.
- Requires knowledge of SQL commands and syntax.
- Provides more flexibility and control over database operations.

## Learning with MySQL
- We are using **MySQL** to understand database components.
- We will install both the **client** and **server** on our system to practice database operations.
