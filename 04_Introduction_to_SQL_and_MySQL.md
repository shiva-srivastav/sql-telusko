# **Introduction to SQL and MySQL**

### **What is SQL?**
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with RDBMS.
- It is used to **store, retrieve, and manipulate** data in a relational database.
- SQL commands are used to perform operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data.
- Writing SQL commands for any operation is referred to as an **SQL Query**.

### **What is MySQL?**
- MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
- It is used to store and manage data in a **structured and organized** way.
- MySQL ensures that data is stored **securely** and is **accessible anytime**.
- It allows users to communicate with the database using **SQL queries**.
- MySQL is widely used in web applications, enterprise systems, and cloud databases.

### **Key Differences between SQL and MySQL**
| Feature | SQL | MySQL |
|---------|------|-------|
| Definition | A query language for managing data in RDBMS | A database management system that implements SQL |
| Usage | Used to query and manipulate data | Used to store and manage relational data |
| Type | Language | Software |
| Operations | Defines and manipulates data | Stores, processes, and secures data |

By using **SQL** commands in **MySQL**, we can efficiently work with databases and perform various operations on stored data.
